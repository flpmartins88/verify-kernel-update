# verify-kernel-update

A small utility to help to update ubuntu kernel to last version.

If you want a more stable, easy and reliable tool, use the [ubuntu-mainline-kernel script](https://github.com/pimlie/ubuntu-mainline-kernel.sh).

I want to turn this project in something like Kotlin Script or Clojure Script, to easily download and install.
